# My Blockchain Experiments   

1. Learned basics of contracts via Remix (an open-source, browser-first integrated development environment for building, debugging and deploying EVM-compatible smart contracts)

### Explored Ethereum basics:

- Installed **MetaMask** (a browser extension wallet that lets you manage Ethereum accounts and interact with decentralized apps).
- Created an account on **Infura** (a service that provides remote Ethereum nodes, allowing you to deploy and interact with smart contracts without running a full node).
- Did a **Brownie** setup (a Python-based framework for writing, testing, and deploying Ethereum smart contracts).
- Set up a local Ethereum blockchain using **Ganache** (a personal blockchain for testing smart contracts locally).
- Wrote and tested a few **sample smart contracts**.

### Few commands:

```bash
npm install -g ganache
npm install -g npm@11.6.0

brownie init
brownie compile
brownie run <file>

```

Also learned about **pip** and **pipx**, though I didnâ€™t use pipx.

**Difference between pip and pipx:**

- `pip` installs Python libraries for your specific project, often inside a virtual environment.
- `pipx` installs standalone Python applications that you can run from your command line anywhere on your system, without causing conflicts.

Also explored **faucets** (websites that provide free test Ether to use on testnets like *Sepolia* and *Holesky* for development and experimentation).
