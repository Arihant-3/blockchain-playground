# My Blockchain Experiments   

1. Learned basics of contracts via Remix (an open-source, browser-first integrated development environment for building, debugging and deploying EVM-compatible smart contracts)

### Explored Ethereum basics:

- Installed **MetaMask** (a browser extension wallet that lets you manage Ethereum accounts and interact with decentralized apps).

---

Also learned about **pip** and **pipx**, though I didnâ€™t use pipx.

**Difference between pip and pipx:**

- `pip` installs Python libraries for your specific project, often inside a virtual environment.
- `pipx` installs standalone Python applications that you can run from your command line anywhere on your system, without causing conflicts.

Also explored **faucets** (websites that provide free test Ether to use on testnets like *Sepolia* and *Holesky* for development and experimentation).

2. Deployed **Simple Storage** on the local network.
